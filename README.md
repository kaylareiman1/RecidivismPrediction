Prompt: 
Many jurisdictions around the United States are using risk assessment instruments (RAIs) in helping judges make bail decisions. Pre-trial RAIs are often statistical models that try to predict the likelihood that an individual will commit a crime if released on bail pending their court date. For the past several years, the courts in Broward County, Florida have been using one of the RAIs in the COMPAS suite to inform their decisions. In May of 2016 an investigative journalism team at ProPublica published a report that analysed whether COMPAS might be racially biased. You will use the publicly released data from their analysis in performing the key tasks below.
Key tasks
1.	The COMPAS tool was not developed on the Broward County population. Going forward, the County is considering developing their own RAI to replace COMPAS. Using the available data, construct an RAI for predicting two-year recidivism. Evaluate the predictive performance of your model. What are the most important predictors of recidivism?
2.	Construct an RAI for predicting violent recidivism. Evaluate the predictive performance of your model. What are the most important predictors of violent recidivism? How do they compare to the important predictors of general recidivism?
3.	Are your RAIs from (1) and (2) equally predictive across race/ethnicity groups? How about across age and sex groups?
4.	Compare your RAIs to the COMPAS RAI. Do your RAIs perform better or worse than COMPAS? Do your RAIs produce similar classifications to COMPAS? Can you identify any systematic differences between your classifications and those of COMPAS?

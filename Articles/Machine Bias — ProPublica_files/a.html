 so-called 'unbiased' [Oh really?] Assessment report, as a computer 
based 'predictor' of the likelihood that an offender may offend again, 
asks 137 questions- which IMO could / should be cut-down to just 1/2 or 
even 1/3 of that. A number of questions are thinly disguised racially 
biased, &amp; many are quite redundant [IE: it asks about gang 
affiliation at-least 3 or 4 different Xs]. In fact many or most [or even
 all] of some entire sections are questionable at best: IE: Under Family
 Criminality: Asks if you were raised by both parents or NOT, or if 
you're adopted or raised in foster care [obviously this is biased vs 
Black people], then if your parents &amp;/or even siblings were ever 
arrested, &amp; then asks again if they were ever convicted [= 
redundant].</p><p>Then there's the sections on Work / Hire-ability, 
&amp; Education- obviously since Blacks' unemployment rate has for 
decades been 2Xs that of whites, this is biased vs Blacks. Then it even 
asks even if you do work, does your [lack of] Education &amp; Skills set
 only allow you to at-best get minimum wage jobs- Huhh WTF!! Damn! Talk 
about a Black guy can't win for losing!! <br>- Then there's a section 
asking if you've got financial problems. So just how many Black &amp; 
Brown [&amp; even working class white] folks, do NOT have some financial
 'issues' from time to time- in such a currently depressed economy???</p><p>They
 even use where one lives against Blacks [sections: Resident Stability 
&amp; Social Environment {= if you live in a Hi Crime Area]- IMO that 
should only be relevant if you’ve actually have a prior felony 
conviction, especially for committing a felony in that &amp;/or nearby 
&amp;/or similar type neighborhood.</p><p>The whole section on Leisure- about how bored one ‘feels’ is IMO of dubious relevance.</p><p>The
 Criminal Personality section is IMO most 'ironic'- Because IMO if the 
average Poly-trician &amp;/or Wall St Bankster [&amp; even cop too] took
 it, they'd FAIL miserably- 'IF' they'd ever even answer truthfully!!!</p><p>Other
 ironic questions ask about 'Feeling the need to be armed to be safe in 
your own neighborhood- Ironic considering that it's FOX Noise / 'Good 
Ole Boy' type White Guys who're the most heavily armed &amp; vocal NRA /
 2nd Amendment / SYG / concealed &amp; open-carry hard-core 
staunch-proponents in the entire US!!!</p><p>'I won't hesitate to 
threaten &amp; even hurt someone who's hurt my family &amp;/or friends' -
 Quite ironic in this post 9-11 GWOT era, where we've got the Top Repug 
POTUS candidates openly calling for killing off 'alleged' Islamic 
'terrorists' entire families in retaliation, &amp; Dim Billary's bloody 
track-record in Iraq, Libya, Syria &amp; she's threatened to 'Obliterate
 Iran' if it attacks Israel [w non-existent nukes]!!!</p><p>Then there's
 the last question: 'Some folks don't deserve respect &amp; should be 
treated just like animals'- Quite ironic since that would seem to be 
exactly the attitude of the US' racially biased criminalized injustice 
system re: so many Blacks- especially those who are / have been in 
prison!!</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more" title="see more" data-action="see-more">see more</a></div><footer class="comment__footer"><menu class="comment-footer__menu"><li class="voting" data-role="voting"><div class="post-votes"><a href="#" class="vote-up  count-3" data-action="upvote" title="" name="Vote up"><span class="updatable count" data-role="likes">3</span> <span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow-2"></i></span></a><div class="post-votes__separator"></div><a href="#" class="vote-down  count-0" data-action="downvote" title="Vote down" name="Vote down"><span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow"></i></span> <span class="updatable count" data-role="dislikes">0</span></a></div></li><li class="bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</li><li class="comment__share"><a class="toggle" tabindex="0"><span class="text">Share ›</span></a><ul class="comment-share__buttons"><div class="comment-share__social-share-buttons"><li class="twitter"><button class="share__button icon icon-twitter" data-action="share:twitter"></button></li><li class="facebook"><button class="share__button icon icon-facebook" data-action="share:facebook"></button></li></div><li class="link"><button class="share__button icon icon-link" value="http://disq.us/p/18lc8ea" name="Link" title="Click to copy post link" data-action="copy-link"></button><input class="share__button link_url" name="Link" title="Click to copy post link" data-action="copy-link" readonly="readonly" value="http://disq.us/p/18lc8ea"></li></ul></li><li class="realtime" data-role="realtime-notification:2696354434"><span style="display: none;" class="realtime-replies"></span><a style="display: none;" href="#" class="realtime-button"></a></li></menu></footer></div><div data-role="blacklist-form"></div><div data-role="flagging-form"></div><div class="reply-form-container" data-role="reply-form"></div></div><div class="children"><ul data-role="children"></ul><div class="show-children-wrapper hidden"><a class="show-children" id="post-2696354434-show-children" data-action="show-children" href="#">Show more replies</a></div></div></li></ul><div class="show-children-wrapper hidden"><a class="show-children" id="post-2691112136-show-children" data-action="show-children" href="#">Show more replies</a></div></div></li><li class="post" id="post-2698609287"><div role="alert"></div><div data-role="post-content" class="post-content" tabindex="0"><div class="indicator"></div><ul class="post-menu dropdown" data-role="menu" data-view-id="post-menu" data-post-id="2698609287"><li class="collapse"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Collapse" name="Collapse"><span>−</span></a></li><li class="expand"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Expand" name="Collapse"><span>+</span></a></li><li class="" role="menuitem"><a class="dropdown-toggle" href="#" data-action="flag" data-role="flag" title="Flag as inappropriate"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-flag"></i></a></li></ul><div class="avatar hovercard"><a href="https://disqus.com/by/MikeCody/" data-action="profile" data-username="MikeCody" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="user"><img data-role="user-avatar" data-user="31803906" src="a_data/noavatar92.png" alt="Avatar"></a></div><div class="post-body"><header class="comment__header"><span class="post-byline"><span> <span class="author publisher-anchor-color"><a href="https://disqus.com/by/MikeCody/" data-action="profile" data-username="MikeCody" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MikeCody</a></span> </span><span> <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing#comment-2690805097" class="parent-link" data-role="parent-link"><i aria-label="in reply to" class="icon-forward" title="in reply to"></i> Lars Carlson</a></span></span> <span class="post-meta"><span class="bullet time-ago-bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</span> <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing#comment-2698609287" data-role="relative-time" class="time-ago" title="Friday, May 27, 2016 1:09 PM">4 years ago</a> </span>  </header><div class="post-body-inner"><div class="post-message-container" data-role="message-container"><div class="publisher-anchor-color" data-role="message-content"><div class="post-message " data-role="message" dir="auto"><div><p>Every

 may not be perfect, but consider that I know precisely one person who 
has been murdered, and the murder rate here is 1.0 per 100,000, vs 3.8 
per 100,000 in the USA.<br>As for reported violence? If you never see violence, you remember it. If it is everyday, you forget the majority.</p><p>But enough statistics, have an "anecdata".</p><p>I
 work a "high risk" job. One I feel pretty sure would've got me into a 
lot of violence in the USA - indeed, I know that warrants are largely 
served by SWAT in the US now. In the course of ~10 years doing warrant 
entries, breaking in to thousands of homes and businesses a year, 
without anything more than a bit of paper, a Warrant Officer (unarmed, 
not even a stab vest) &amp; an engineer (for the gas or electric meter),
 I have experienced violence. We've had a few "close calls" - a guy with
 guns, a few with axes, etc., many drug farms (nearly all grow houses), 
&amp; yes,  I've been assaulted. I've been assaulted twice.</p><p>Twice.
 In total, over thousands of jobs where *we literally bang on your door 
until you answer*, and if you don't, I pick the locks and we let 
ourselves in. And if you are inside, we tell you we have a warrant and 
refuse to leave.</p><p>We call the police if we feel we need to, I think 3 times in one week is the most, &amp; we sometimes do 8 jobs a day.</p><p>So no. Actual "what an American would call violence" violent crime is tiny over here. And our murder rate is a quarter yours. </p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more" data-action="see-more">see more</a></div><footer class="comment__footer"><menu class="comment-footer__menu"><li class="voting" data-role="voting"><div class="post-votes"><a href="#" class="vote-up  count-4" data-action="upvote" title="" name="Vote up"><span class="updatable count" data-role="likes">4</span> <span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow-2"></i></span></a><div class="post-votes__separator"></div><a href="#" class="vote-down  count-0" data-action="downvote" title="Vote down" name="Vote down"><span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow"></i></span> <span class="updatable count" data-role="dislikes">0</span></a></div></li><li class="bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</li><li class="comment__share"><a class="toggle" tabindex="0"><span class="text">Share ›</span></a><ul class="comment-share__buttons"><div class="comment-share__social-share-buttons"><li class="twitter"><button class="share__button icon icon-twitter" data-action="share:twitter"></button></li><li class="facebook"><button class="share__button icon icon-facebook" data-action="share:facebook"></button></li></div><li class="link"><button class="share__button icon icon-link" value="http://disq.us/p/18izun5" name="Link" title="Click to copy post link" data-action="copy-link"></button><input class="share__button link_url" name="Link" title="Click to copy post link" data-action="copy-link" readonly="readonly" value="http://disq.us/p/18izun5"></li></ul></li><li class="realtime" data-role="realtime-notification:2692417505"><span style="display: none;" class="realtime-replies"></span><a style="display: none;" href="#" class="realtime-button"></a></li></menu></footer></div><div data-role="blacklist-form"></div><div data-role="flagging-form"></div><div class="reply-form-container" data-role="reply-form"></div></div><div class="children"><ul data-role="children"></ul><div class="show-children-wrapper hidden"><a class="show-children" id="post-2692417505-show-children" data-action="show-children" href="#">Show more replies</a></div></div></li></ul><div class="show-children-wrapper hidden"><a class="show-children" id="post-2692238948-show-children" data-action="show-children" href="#">Show more replies</a></div></div></li></ul><div class="show-children-wrapper hidden"><a class="show-children" id="post-2691988341-show-children" data-action="show-children" href="#">Show more replies</a></div></div></li></ul><div class="show-children-wrapper hidden"><a class="show-children" id="post-2691940950-show-children" data-action="show-children" href="#">Show more replies</a></div></div></li></ul><div class="show-children-wrapper hidden"><a class="show-children" id="post-2690805097-show-children" data-action="show-children" href="#">Show more replies</a></div></div></li><li class="post" id="post-2691528084"><div role="alert"></div><div data-role="post-content" class="post-content" tabindex="0"><div class="indicator"></div><ul class="post-menu dropdown" data-role="menu" data-view-id="post-menu" data-post-id="2691528084"><li class="collapse"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Collapse" name="Collapse"><span>−</span></a></li><li class="expand"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Expand" name="Collapse"><span>+</span></a></li><li class="" role="menuitem"><a class="dropdown-toggle" href="#" data-action="flag" data-role="flag" title="Flag as inappropriate"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-flag"></i></a></li></ul><div class="avatar hovercard"><a href="https://disqus.com/by/barfcom/" data-action="profile" data-username="barfcom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="user"><img data-role="user-avatar" data-user="80156970" src="a_data/noavatar92.png" alt="Avatar"></a></div><div class="post-body"><header class="comment__header"><span class="post-byline"><span> <span class="author publisher-anchor-color"><a href="https://disqus.com/by/barfcom/" data-action="profile" data-username="barfcom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Barry</a></span> </span></span> <span class="post-meta"><span class="bullet time-ago-bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</span> <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing#comment-2691528084" data-role="relative-time" class="time-ago" title="Monday, May 23, 2016 5:03 PM">4 years ago</a> </span>  </header><div class="post-body-inner"><div class="post-message-container" data-role="message-container"><div class="publisher-anchor-color" data-role="message-content"><div class="post-message " data-role="message" dir="auto"><div><p>Wow.

 to prison when he was a child?</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more" data-action="see-more">see more</a></div><footer class="comment__footer"><menu class="comment-footer__menu"><li class="voting" data-role="voting"><div class="post-votes"><a href="#" class="vote-up  count-1" data-action="upvote" title="" name="Vote up"><span class="updatable count" data-role="likes">1</span> <span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow-2"></i></span></a><div class="post-votes__separator"></div><a href="#" class="vote-down  count-0" data-action="downvote" title="Vote down" name="Vote down"><span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow"></i></span> <span class="updatable count" data-role="dislikes">0</span></a></div></li><li class="bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</li><li class="comment__share"><a class="toggle" tabindex="0"><span class="text">Share ›</span></a><ul class="comment-share__buttons"><div class="comment-share__social-share-buttons"><li class="twitter"><button class="share__button icon icon-twitter" data-action="share:twitter"></button></li><li class="facebook"><button class="share__button icon icon-facebook" data-action="share:facebook"></button></li></div><li class="link"><button class="share__button icon icon-link" value="http://disq.us/p/18tohpi" name="Link" title="Click to copy post link" data-action="copy-link"></button><input class="share__button link_url" name="Link" title="Click to copy post link" data-action="copy-link" readonly="readonly" value="http://disq.us/p/18tohpi"></li></ul></li><li class="realtime" data-role="realtime-notification:2710363302"><span style="display: none;" class="realtime-replies"></span><a style="display: none;" href="#" class="realtime-button"></a></li></menu></footer></div><div data-role="blacklist-form"></div><div data-role="flagging-form"></div><div class="reply-form-container" data-role="reply-form"></div></div><div class="children"><ul data-role="children"><li class="post" id="post-2788906605"><div role="alert"></div><div data-role="post-content" class="post-content" tabindex="0"><div class="indicator"></div><ul class="post-menu dropdown" data-role="menu" data-view-id="post-menu" data-post-id="2788906605"><li class="collapse"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Collapse" name="Collapse"><span>−</span></a></li><li class="expand"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Expand" name="Collapse"><span>+</span></a></li><li class="" role="menuitem"><a class="dropdown-toggle" href="#" data-action="flag" data-role="flag" title="Flag as inappropriate"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-flag"></i></a></li></ul><div class="avatar hovercard"><a href="https://disqus.com/by/kal_e/" data-action="profile" data-username="kal_e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="user"><img data-role="user-avatar" data-user="200450737" src="a_data/noavatar92.png" alt="Avatar"></a></div><div class="post-body"><header class="comment__header"><span class="post-byline"><span> <span class="author publisher-anchor-color"><a href="https://disqus.com/by/kal_e/" data-action="profile" data-username="kal_e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kal E</a></span> </span><span> <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing#comment-2710363302" class="parent-link" data-role="parent-link"><i aria-label="in reply to" class="icon-forward" title="in reply to"></i> David Pittelli</a></span></span> <span class="post-meta"><span class="bullet time-ago-bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</span> <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing#comment-2788906605" data-role="relative-time" class="time-ago" title="Monday, July 18, 2016 12:28 AM">4 years ago</a> </span>  </header><div class="post-body-inner"><div class="post-message-container" data-role="message-container"><div class="publisher-anchor-color" data-role="message-content"><div class="post-message " data-role="message" dir="auto"><div><p>It

 have been working as a statistician for 10 years, which is relevant 
when I say that predictive models are always wrong.  They are even more 
wrong when it comes to predicting human behavior.</p><p>Surprisingly, 
this model seems to be doing pretty well on an overall level. 70% for a 
consumer model would be amazing. The problem is, this isn't a consumer 
model, this is a model that is impacting the lives of individuals.  And 
it is wrong, analysts know it is going to be wrong some percentage of 
the time.</p><p>I have some general ideas how the strong racial bias 
could have happened from a modeling perspective. Often there are hidden 
relationships in the data that are difficult to see, which is why the 
concept of "Correlation does not imply Causation" is so critical to all 
modeling endeavors. <br>For instance the percentage of the black 
population with family members in prison is higher than the non black 
population. It is likely that race SHOULD have been considered in order 
to control for the pre exsisting racial bias in our current system. 
There are many other possible reasons for the model to behave this way.</p><p>But
 the reasons behind this racial bias are not the point. This is a model 
that the modelers should never have built, in my opinion. Or at the very
 least it should never have been deployed this way. Handing a simplistic
 analysis like this off to non analysts without a very strong sense of 
it's error and overall limitations is just a set up for failure.</p><p>Some times the question is not "Can we predict this?"

 you actually look at the questionnaire on which this {non}'Predictive'

biased [IE: asks about gang affiliation at-least 3Xs - 4Xs]. It has 
whole sections where IMO much/most if not ALL the questions are of 
dubious relevance [IE: one section asks mainly about boredom]. IMO the 
sections asking about family ties [were / are you raised in a 2 Parent 
home], employment &amp; education status, &amp; if one lives in a 
hi-crime area- are all [blatantly] Biased against Black people [= 
'clever' ways of 'determining' if someone's most likely Black without 
actually asking the question outright].</p><p>Thus IMO this

  Even if you are willing to accept (much) higher crime rates in your 
community to reduce incarceration, the reality is that many people are 
not willing to make these choices.   You cannot simply will them away.  
Given this reality it seems to me that there are good welfare enhancing 
arguments for accepting a model like this, even knowing that they are 
imperfect (both type I and type II errors), because they are the least 
bad choice that we have.   You know what they say about making the 
perfect the enemy of the good.....</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more" data-action="see-more">see more</a></div><footer class="comment__footer"><menu class="comment-footer__menu"><li class="voting" data-role="voting"><div class="post-votes"><a href="#" class="vote-up  count-0" data-action="upvote" title="Vote up" name="Vote up"><span class="updatable count" data-role="likes">0</span> <span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow-2"></i></span></a><div class="post-votes__separator"></div><a href="#" class="vote-down  count-0" data-action="downvote" title="Vote down" name="Vote down"><span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow"></i></span> <span class="updatable count" data-role="dislikes">0</span></a></div></li><li class="bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</li><li class="comment__share"><a class="toggle" tabindex="0"><span class="text">Share ›</span></a><ul class="comment-share__buttons"><div class="comment-share__social-share-buttons"><li class="twitter"><button class="share__button icon icon-twitter" data-action="share:twitter"></button></li><li class="facebook"><button class="share__button icon icon-facebook" data-action="share:facebook"></button></li></div><li class="link"><button class="share__button icon icon-link" value="http://disq.us/p/18iak6l" name="Link" title="Click to copy post link" data-action="copy-link"></button><input class="share__button link_url" name="Link" title="Click to copy post link" data-action="copy-link" readonly="readonly" value="http://disq.us/p/18iak6l"></li></ul></li><li class="realtime" data-role="realtime-notification:2691237549"><span style="display: none;" class="realtime-replies"></span><a style="display: none;" href="#" class="realtime-button"></a></li></menu></footer></div><div data-role="blacklist-form"></div><div data-role="flagging-form"></div><div class="reply-form-container" data-role="reply-form"></div></div><div class="children"><ul data-role="children"><li class="post" id="post-2691249345"><div role="alert"></div><div data-role="post-content" class="post-content" tabindex="0"><div class="indicator"></div><ul class="post-menu dropdown" data-role="menu" data-view-id="post-menu" data-post-id="2691249345"><li class="collapse"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Collapse" name="Collapse"><span>−</span></a></li><li class="expand"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Expand" name="Collapse"><span>+</span></a></li><li class="" role="menuitem"><a class="dropdown-toggle" href="#" data-action="flag" data-role="flag" title="Flag as inappropriate"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-flag"></i></a></li></ul><div class="avatar hovercard"><a href="https://disqus.com/by/shinobi42/" data-action="profile" data-username="shinobi42" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="user"><img data-role="user-avatar" data-user="1707811" src="a_data/noavatar92.png" alt="Avatar"></a></div><div class="post-body"><header class="comment__header"><span class="post-byline"><span> <span class="author publisher-anchor-color"><a href="https://disqus.com/by/shinobi42/" data-action="profile" data-username="shinobi42" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shinobi42</a></span> </span><span> <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing#comment-2691237549" class="parent-link" data-role="parent-link"><i aria-label="in reply to" class="icon-forward" title="in reply to"></i> RCA</a></span></span> <span class="post-meta"><span class="bullet time-ago-bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</span> <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing#comment-2691249345" data-role="relative-time" class="time-ago" title="Monday, May 23, 2016 2:27 PM">4 years ago</a> </span>  </header><div class="post-body-inner"><div class="post-message-container" data-role="message-container"><div class="publisher-anchor-color" data-role="message-content"><div class="post-message " data-role="message" dir="auto"><div><p>I

 haven't spent much time looking at the questionnaire, but the actual

 Line: After reading this questionnaire if I were the lawyer for a Black
 defendant, I'd advise my Black Client to refuse to answer this 
questionnaire the same way lawyers usually advise their clients against 
testifying against / incriminating themselves in court &amp; against 
taking lie-detector tests- which at an 80%  success rate is apparently 
significantly more 'reliable' than this biased 'Minority {pre-crime} 
Report'.</p><p>In fact IMO the NAACP &amp; ACLU should challenge the 
validity of using this questionnaire in court, using the illegality of 
using failed lie-detector tests as 'evidence' vs defendants in court as a
 precedence, along w this questionnaire's apparent racial biases.<br>IMO
 it's amazing you think this test that's just 62% - 63% accurate [per 
you] is somehow 'good' enough- when almost every official test one 
takes, a 62% score is a 'D minus'!! Especially considering that failed 
lie-detector tests [w an 80% accuracy rate] can NOT be uses against 
defendants in court, even though an 80% score = a 'B minus'.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more"

 of racist enforcement of laws AND the creation of laws that target

statistical analyses of crime. This then creates a feedback loop where

 enough, if ProPublica have done their stats homework correctly here 
(and that is an if - it's not easy), then what they've found is evidence
 of this. If the profiling software doesn't look explicitly at race, but
 returns predictions that are disfavorable to blacks - well, another way
 of saying the same thing is that their test shows blacks do better than
 their circumstances suggest. So if they included race as an explicit 
factor in their model, not only would it be more predictive, it would be
 better for blacks as well...</p><p>There are some big ifs about that, 
though. Frankly, I have my doubts. Also, even if this happy result holds
 up for this particular variable (race), I think that we should oppose 
it on general principle. You should not be judged for those of your 
characteristics you obviously have no power over.</p><p>The correct 
approach is to make the models so that they are actively blinded to the 
protected characteristics - so that if you look at the variables, your 
guess about the subject's race or gender would be no better than random.
 This is possible in this day and age. Northpointe's techniques are 
simplistic by today's standards (and probably their own time's).</p><p>And
 yes, predictive accuracy might suffer - but that's the price we pay for
 equality.
